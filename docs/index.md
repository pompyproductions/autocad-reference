# Eren's AutoCAD reference

## Quickstart

If you want to set up AutoCAD the way I recommend (and use it personally), check out the [configuration page](configuration/index.md).

For information about specific commands/variables, head over to the [reference pages](reference/index.md).

## What to expect

Is a reference for best practices.

Assumes a basic level of AutoCAD literacy (originally aimed at colleagues).

Highly opinionated.

Tips and tricks, setup, useful LISPs.

## What not to expect

Not a step-by-step tutorial, but a reference.

Not comprehensive, just pointers for particular things.

Commands are always presented in English. Invoke those commands with an underscore, and it will appear in your own language once you hit enter.
