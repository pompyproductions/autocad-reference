# Welcome to Eren's AutoCAD reference!

_Note: this project is still in development. Check back every once in a while for new content!_

## Where to start?

[→ Configuration:](configuration/index.md) Setting up your working environment. If you haven't done so before, **I strongly recommend that you read through this section at least once.**   
[→ Workflow:](workflow/index.md) Tried and true good practices.  
[→ Reference:](reference/index.md) Specific information on commands/variables/etc.  
[→ Common questions:](frequent/index.md) Solutions to commonly encountered issues.

## Do we really need another AutoCAD tutorial?

First things first— _this is not a tutorial._ It's more like a handbook that you can refer to from time to time.  
Here's a few pointers as to what that means:

- It's **opinionated:** I'm sharing my own method of working with AutoCAD, formed by many years of trial and error, and by responding to real life situations and adapting accordingly. If I don't like how a certain command is used, it's either not there, or advised against.
- It's intentionally **incomplete:** while beginner-friendly in its tone, this reference document does not intend to teach basic commands and guide you through any and every menial task. Rather, it focuses its efforts on how to improve your workflow and how to produce clean, fast documents. Purge the mess away!
- It focuses on **how** rather than **what** to do: the main emphasis here is on how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to achieve 80% of the results with 20% of the effort. 

I decided to create this handbook not because I claim that AutoCAD is the _only_ way to go, but because I often find myself elucidating on the inner workings of AutoCAD to my dear friends and peers, and so that they could have access to this information even when I'm not around.

### "Why don't you do Revit instead?"

While I can't argue that there are many other pieces of software that are more suited to architectural work _(Revit, ArchiCAD, Rhinoceros...),_ AutoCAD still remains a staple in architectural practice. 

My goal here is not to evangelize AutoCAD and claim that it's the superior choice. I'm here because I use AutoCAD on a daily basis, and _I've seen my fair share of horrors._ Whether we like it or not, AutoCAD is not going anywhere, and it's my hope that this guide just might alleviate the pain, and help you create documents _you're proud of,_ and _you're praised for._

## What to expect

In the ["Configuration"](configuration/index.md) section, you'll find some useful tips and tricks to make your experience with AutoCAD a little smoother, and a little more personalized. Aside from instructions on how to tweak the behavior of AutoCAD to your liking, I also included my own settings, that come from a lot of trial and error as well as experience and guidence from my peers.

The ["Workflow"](workflow/index.md) section focuses on implementing healthy habits and avoiding common pitfalls when working with AutoCAD. As mentioned earlier, the main focus here is **how** to approach our tasks and objectives, not **what buttons to push.**   

As for the ["Reference"](reference/index.md) section, it's a glossary packed with the inner workings of commands and variables. Even after years and years of intensive use, it's not uncommon to come by new ways of using these things. You can use this section for finding curious new ways to work, or to master the tools that you always reach for. Heard about a certain command/variable but not sure as to what it does? This is the place.

Finally, we have the ["Common Questions"](frequent/index.md) section that's exactly what it sounds like: issues that I've heard or encountered many times, and for which there are certain solutions that just make more sense than others.

## A language & localization disclamer

For the moment, this reference document is presented entirely in English. It's still very much a work in progress, and I'd rather focus my efforts into producing as much as possible, rather than trying too many things at once, only to never finish this.

That being said, I'm definitely planning to add language support to this project in the long run (starting with French). 

Until then, commands will always be presented in English. But fret not! If you're using a different language AutoCAD distribution, you can invoke those commands with an underscore at the beginning (e.g. `_POLYLINE`). Not only will it work, but **it will also display the command in your own language,** which you can keep using afterwards.

Also, even though I use the metric system of measurement, most (if not all) of the content here will work fine in imperial units. Adapt the numbers to your liking!
