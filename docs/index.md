# Eren's AutoCAD reference

Project in development.

## Quickstart

[→ Configuration:](configuration/index.md) Setting up your working environment.  
[→ Workflow:](workflow/index.md) Tried and true good practices.  
[→ Reference:](reference/index.md) Specific information on commands/variables/etc.  
[→ Common questions:](frequent/index.md) Solutions to commonly encountered issues.

## What to expect

Is a reference for best practices.

Assumes a basic level of AutoCAD literacy (originally aimed at colleagues).

Highly opinionated.

Tips and tricks, setup, useful LISPs.

## What not to expect

Not a step-by-step tutorial, but a reference.

Not comprehensive, just pointers for particular things.

Commands are always presented in English. Invoke those commands with an underscore, and it will appear in your own language once you hit enter.
