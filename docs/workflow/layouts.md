# Layouts

(cartouche could be a block or xref, up to you)

(use blocks with attributes to easily switch info)

(align drawings, not viewports!)

(lock your viewports always)

(use -zoom for scale, -p to move. line them up nicely)

(have guides for lining things up)

(chspace, ps, ms are your friends)
