# External references (XREF)

`XATTACH` with world UCS.

Important to keep the same reference point for all drawings. If you separate your cross sections, your different floor plans, and your fa√ßades, it might be worthwhile to position them in a way they can be all inserted into a single file without clashing.

Depending on your preferred workflow, this might mean different things:
- All floor plans at the same position, and cross sections offset to each side.
- The "base" floor plan (usually ground floor) in place, the various other floor plans at a set distance, and cross sections around.

## BASE

Although very rare, it's possible to find drawings whose "basepoint" is different than 0, which displaces the drawing when placed as an external reference.

**It is strongly recommended to keep this at 0,0,0 even though it might seem useful at first.** Think about other people who might have to use your files.
