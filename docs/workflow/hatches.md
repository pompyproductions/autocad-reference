# Hatches

(always associate)

(keep guide polylines in a separate layer)

(keep different kinds of hatches in separate layers that you create on the go)

(use hatches for masks but don't overuse them. don't make them 255 255 255, use your ctb for that, like 11)

(hatches can have a pattern and a background. sometimes you might want a white background for a hatch, and if your hatch needs to be on a "white" layer you won't be able to see your hatch over the "255" background.)

(you can decide an origin point for all your hatches so that they line up nicely)
