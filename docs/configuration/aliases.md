# Aliases (shortcuts for AutoCAD commands)

AutoCAD, as a software, is centered around commands and keyboard input. The existence of a graphical user interface makes it more approachable, but underneath, it's all commands.

While the menu is quite useful for commands that you use less often, if you find yourself reaching for the same ones over and over again, it's incomparably faster to use the keyboard to type in the command (or its _alias_, as we'll soon see.)

## Default aliases

By default, AutoCAD provides a long list of aliases that are usually intuitive and straightforward. Here are some of the most useful ones, as defined in the "acad.pgp" file:


```title="acad.pgp"
AR,        *ARRAY
-AR,       *-ARRAY
B,         *BLOCK
BE,        *BLOCKEDIT
BO,        *BOUNDARY
CP,        *COPY
```

_These bindings will probably be different if you're using AutoCAD with a different language._
