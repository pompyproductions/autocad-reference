# AutoCAD Options

## Pressing SHIFT to grab snap points

(under Drafting > Alignment Point Acquisition)

## Don't make the cursor too big (or too small)

(under Selection > Pickbox size)

## Save to an older format

(under Open and Save > File Save)

## Keep a dark theme

This should be obvious, but first of all, keep the display as intended: dark background, draw in bright colors. This is not only for your own sake, but for everyone else who will have to open your files in the future: if you make your background light, you have to make your drawing dark, and the vast majority who stick with the dark background will open your files only to curse you.

An important thing to consider is to avoid using pure black for your background (#000000).
