# Configuration

Before you jump into making shapes and such, make sure you and your software are prepared for what's to come.  
If it's your first time here, **I recommend you read through these in the order presented below.**

## Setting up your work environment

[→ AutoCAD Options:](options.md) optimize AutoCAD parameters for a better experience overall.  
[→ AutoCAD System Variables:](variables.md) make AutoCAD behave in a way that'll enable you to work faster and cleaner.  
[→ Command Aliases:](aliases.md) invoke your most used commands without having to type in the whole thing.  

## Adding some extras

[→ CTBs:](ctb.md) make it so that your colorful layers produce a beautiful drawing on paper (or PDF).  
[→ Styles:](styles.md) lay the groundwork for annotating your drawings.  
[→ LISPs:](lisps.md) patch up your AutoCAD with functions that should exist, but don't.
