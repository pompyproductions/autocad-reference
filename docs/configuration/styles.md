# Annotation Styles

## Using custom blocks

Strong recommend making your own arrows and such. Not only do you learn a lot, but also does it look much better and more professional (not to mention how big of a flex it is, to show that you know your stuff).

## Text

First one to take care of.

## Leaders

(Custom blocks for arrows)  
(Custom blocks for content)

## Dimlines

(Custom blocks for markers)  
(Set the linetype of your extension lines, but keep it off)  
(You _could_ make different styles for extension and not, but better to keep it simple and not have to deal with too many styles if you need to update them)  
(Addselected and matchprop will do most of the heavy lifting anyway so keep it minimal)

## Tables

I'm not going to get into this yet, because of recent trauma.  
Just keep in mind that you can create table styles, and that tables in AutoCAD are nightmare material...
